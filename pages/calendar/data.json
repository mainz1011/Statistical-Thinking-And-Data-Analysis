Prentice Hall, 1999. ISBN: 9780137444267.\nCHAPTERS TITLES TOPICS 2 Review of Probability Computing probabilities: conditional probabilities and Bayes\u0026rsquo; rule Quantiles/percentiles, CDF\u0026rsquo;s, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, covariance, various distributions and what they are used for (particularly Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, Hypergeometric, Poisson, normal) 3 Collecting Data Sampling terminology: convenience sampling, SRS, stratified random sampling, multistage cluster sampling, 1 in K 4 Summarizing and Exploring Data Summarizing univariate data: numerically (sample mean, IQR, etc.) and by plotting (pie/bar/pareto chart for categorical data, histogram, box plot, normal plot) Summarizing bivariate data: Simpson\u0026rsquo;s paradox, scatter plot, sample correlation coefficient Time series: MA, EWMA, forecast error and MAPE, auto-correlation coefficient Exam 1: Chapters 2-4 5 Sampling Distributions of Statistics Normal approximation to binomial distribution (which relies on the CLT), computing probabilities with chi-square distribution, t-distribution, F-distribution 6 Basic Concepts of Inference Bias, MSE, setting up hypotheses, Type I error, Type II error, power For z-test: z-scores, p-values, confidence intervals 7 Inferences for Single Samples Sample size calculation for confidence intervals on z-test, sample calculation for z-test, sample size calculation for power on z-test, t-test, chi-square test for variance 8 Inferences for Two Samples QQ plots Comparison of two means for independent samples design (large samples z-test, small sample t-test using either a pooled variance or the Welch-Sattethwaite method) Comparison of two means for matched pairs design (t-test, power and sample-size calculation for power) Comparison of variance using the F-test Exam 2: Chapters 5-8 9 Inferences for Proportions and Count Data Comparison to a given proportion using large sample z-test, sample size calculation for confidence intervals Comparison of two proportions using large sample z-test Chi-square test (multinomial and goodness of fit) 10 Similar Linear Regression and Correlation Computing the least square line, computing r^2, hypothesis testing on beta_1, understanding ANOVA regression tables Checking model assumptions and transforming data 11 Multiple Linear Regression Understanding ANOVA regression tables, t-tests on individual regression coefficients Multicollinearity Logical regression Exam 3: Chapters 9-11 14 Nonparametric Statistical Methods Comparison to a given median using: sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank test (these tests can also be used on the di\u0026rsquo;s for matched pairs) Comparison of two distributions using Rank Sum test or MWU test Rank correlation methods: Spearman\u0026rsquo;s rank coefficient, Kendall\u0026rsquo;s Tau Exam 4: Chapters 12, 14 "}
